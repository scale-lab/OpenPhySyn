## Getting Started

### Read design and run a transform:

```tcl
Psn
import_lef <lef file>
import_def <def file>
transform <transform name> <arguments...>
export_def <def file>
```

### Example: Repair design timing violations

```tcl
Psn ; # or ./build/Psn if not installed in the global path

import_lib ./tests/data/libraries/Nangate45/NangateOpenCellLibrary_typical.lib
import_lef ./tests/data/libraries/Nangate45/NangateOpenCellLibrary.mod.lef
import_def ./tests/data/designs/timing_buffer/ibex_gp.def
read_sdc ./tests/data/designs/timing_buffer/ibex_tight_clk.sdc

set_wire_rc 1.0e-03 1.0e-03 ; # or set_wire_rc <metal layer>

puts "=============== Initial Reports ============="
report_checks
report_check_types -max_slew -max_capacitance -violators
puts "Capacitance violations: [llength [capacitance_violations]]"
puts "Transition violations: [llength [transition_violations]]"
report_wns
report_tns

puts "Initial area: [expr round([design_area] * 10E12) ] um2"

puts "OpenPhySyn timing repair:"
repair_timing

puts "=============== Final Reports ============="
report_checks
report_check_types -max_slew -max_capacitance -violators
puts "Capacitance violations: [llength [capacitance_violations]]"
puts "Transition violations: [llength [transition_violations]]"
report_wns
report_tns

puts "Final area: [expr round([design_area] * 10E12) ] um2"

puts "Export optimized design"
export_def optimized.def

exit 0
```

You can also run the previous example from a Tcl script: `./build/Psn ./tests/tcl/getting_started.tcl`

## Default Transforms

By default, the following transforms are built with OpenPhySyn:

-   `buffer_fanout`: adds buffers to high fan-out nets.
-   `gate_clone`: performs load driven gate cloning.
-   `pin_swap`: performs timing-driven/power-driven commutative pin-swapping optimization.
-   `constant_propagation`: perform constant propagation optimization across the design hierarchy.
-   `timing_buffer`: perform van Ginneken based buffer tree insertion to fix capacitance and transition violations.
-   `repair_timing`: repair design timing and electrical violations through resizing, buffer insertion, and pin-swapping.

## Fixing Timing Violations

The `repair_timing` command repairs negative slack, maximum capacitance and transition violations by buffer tree insertion, gate sizing, and pin-swapping.

`repair_timing` options:

-   `[-capacitance_violations]`: Repair capacitance violations.
-   `[-transition_violations]`: Repair transition violations.
-   `[-fanout_violations]`: Repair fanout violations.
-   `[-negative_slack_violations]`: Repair paths with negative slacks.
-   `[-iterations iterations]`: Maximum number of iterations.
-   `[-buffers buffer_cells]`: Manually specify buffer cells to use.
-   `[-inverters inverter cells]`: Manually specify inverter cells to use.
-   `[-auto_buffer_library <single|small|medium|large|all>]`: Auto-select buffer library.
-   `[-no_minimize_buffer_library]`: Do not run initial pruning phase for buffer selection.
-   `[-auto_buffer_library_inverters_enabled]`: Include inverters in the selected buffer library.
-   `[-buffer_disabled]`: Disable all buffering.
-   `[-resize_disabled]`: Disable driver sizing.
-   `[-pin_swap_disabled]`: Disable pin-swapping.
-   `[-transition_pessimism_factor factor]` Scaling factor for transition violation limits, default is 1.0, should be non-negative, < 1.0 is pessimistic, 1.0 is ideal, > 1.0 is optimistic (default is 1.0).
-   `[-capacitance_pessimism_factor factor]` Scaling factor for capacitance violation limits, default is 1.0, should be non-negative, < 1.0 is pessimistic, 1.0 is ideal, > 1.0 is optimistic (default is 1.0).
-   `[-minimum_cost_buffer_enabled]`: Enable minimum cost buffering.
-   `[-legalization_frequency <num_edits>]`: Legalize after how many edits (has no effect without plugging a legalizer).
-   `[-legalize_eventually]`: Legalize at the end of the optimization (has no effect without plugging a legalizer).
-   `[-legalize_each_iteration]`: Legalize after each iteration (has no effect without plugging a legalizer).
-   `[-post_place|-post_route]`: Post-placement phase mode or post-routing phase mode (post-routing is not currently supported).
-   `[-minimum_gain <unit_time>]`: Minimum slack gain to accept an optimization.
-   `[-high_effort]`: Trade-off runtime versus optimization quality by weaker pruning.
-   `[-no_resize_for_negative_slack]`: Disable resizing when solving negative slack violations (enhances runtime).
-   `[-maximum_negative_slack_paths count]`: Maximum number of negative slack paths to try to optimize.
-   `[-maximum_negative_slack_path_depth count]`: Maximum depth per negative slack path to try to optimize.
-   `[-pins pin_names]`: Manually select the pins to optimize.

> Note: you should run the design through an external legalization pass after the optimization when running without plugging a legalizer or using legalization flags.
